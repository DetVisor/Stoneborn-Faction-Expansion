    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of an insectoid kill squadron. [PAWN_possessive] job was to enter mineshafts that were infested with insectoids in order to fully clear them out. One of [PAWN_objective] favorite insectoid killing methods was to smoke the insects out with a flamethrower before funneling them into her shotgun-armed squadmates./n[PAWN_nameDef] also enjoyed simply caving insectoid heads in with a large hammer.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_pronoun] was knowledgeable in conventional combat techniques, but navigating and engaging the enemy in such small spaces was where [PAWN_nameDef] truly felt at home.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was tasked with watching over the mines that stoneborn were actively working in. For the most part, this meant that [PAWN_pronoun] would make sure that the miners were working efficiently while breaking up the occasional brawl. But when insectoids inevitably burrowed into a mineshaft, [PAWN_nameDef] would eliminate them with ruthless efficiency before they caused too much damage.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] possessed enough influence and combat prowess to be allowed to wield rune-smithed equipment. Such an honor was quite uncommon in stoneborn society due to the quality and price of such items, which made [PAWN_objective] especially stand out from the usual rank-and-file soldiers. A mere glance of [PAWN_nameDef] was enough to inspire fervent bravery in [PAWN_possessive] allies and fear in [PAWN_possessive] foes.</baseDesc>

Of course, while [PAWN_possessive] natural psychic inertness was helpful, [PAWN_pronoun] was no match for a psycaster in direct combat. Thus, [PAWN_nameDef] hunted down psycasters in long range engagements, as psychic powers were not particularly dangerous when they could not reach [PAWN_possessive].</baseDesc>
