        <titleShort>hauler</titleShort>
        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]’s youth was mainly spent carrying unprocessed chunks of ore from one place to another. While this did wonders for [PAWN_possessive] strength and resilience, the tedium of the work dulled [PAWN_possessive] mind and conversational skills, to the point where [PAWN_pronoun] often got into physical altercations with other laborers.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] worked in a particularly busy workshop, assigned to deal with various tasks that the artisans were too busy to do. Hauling resources, sweeping shavings off the floor, and basic tool maintenance took up most of [PAWN_possessive] time. However, on slower days, when all of [PAWN_possessive] assigned work was completed, [PAWN_pronoun] was permitted to learn from one of the artisans about their craft, sparking a deep passion for crafting in [PAWN_nameDef].</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>Born to a poor family, [PAWN_nameDef] was forced to take a job that nearly no one else wanted to do in order to survive: cleaning the forge vents. It was highly unpleasant work, and it carried high risks of [PAWN_nameDef] getting stuck in narrow gaps or being smothered by soot and smoke. This hardship toughened [PAWN_objective] up, but also left [PAWN_objective] with a nasty cough that never quite went away.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>In [PAWN_possessive] youth, [PAWN_nameDef] was tutored by a clan smith. [PAWN_pronoun] was taught general knowledge on metalworking and crafting, as well as some trade secrets that were a speciality of [PAWN_possessive] clan. While [PAWN_pronoun] spent some time smithing, most of [PAWN_nameDef]’s time was spent taking notes.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was mushroom crazy. All [PAWN_pronoun] talked about was mushrooms, whether it was about medicinal, culinary, or even recreational use. All the mushroom talk eventually made [PAWN_possessive] parents sign [PAWN_objective] up as an apprentice under a mushroom cultivator. While the work was grueling, this did little to stem [PAWN_possessive] for mushrooms.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] lived next to a browbull herd, and much of [PAWN_possessive] childhood was spent tending to their needs. Most notable of [PAWN_possessive] jobs was to cook what [PAWN_pronoun] dubbed “slop” for browbulls, which was a nutritional kibble fit for their dietary needs. Most of [PAWN_nameDef]’s time was spent cooking “slop,” and [PAWN_pronoun] very nearly went mad from the horrible smell it produced. At the very least, [PAWN_pronoun] did get very good at making it.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] helped to maintain the underforges during the times where they were not in use. [PAWN_possessive] main tasks were to clean the forges and the floors of scrap metal, soot, and ash. Most of [PAWN_nameDef]’s free time was spent watching the smiths toil away at their creations, and [PAWN_pronoun] often daydreamed of one day working in the forges directly alongside them.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_possessive] job was to cut and polish various precious gems for [PAWN_possessive] master to use, which [PAWN_pronoun] did dutifully. Extended periods of time cutting gems gave [PAWN_pronoun] a sharp eye and a steady hand.</baseDesc>

Day after day, [PAWN_pronoun] hauled heavy objects from one location to another, with little deviation or excitement to break it up. This repetitive and strenuous labor made [PAWN_objective] as strong and tough as a browbull, and about as smart as one too.</baseDesc>

On days where there was not enough stone to cut, [PAWN_pronoun] would help the quarry workers hew stone chunks directly from the earth. This hard labor strengthened [PAWN_possessive] body, though [PAWN_possessive] demanding schedule gave [PAWN_objective] little time to socialize or learn.</baseDesc>
