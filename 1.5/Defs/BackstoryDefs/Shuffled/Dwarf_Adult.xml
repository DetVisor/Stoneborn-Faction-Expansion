    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] worked in a large bakery dedicated to baking rockbread. [PAWN_pronoun] often baked hundreds of platters of rockbread in a single day due to how integral it was in the stoneborn diet. However, [PAWN_possessive] true passion was baking pastries. During lulls in rockbread demand, [PAWN_nameDef] created sublime jelly pastries that were wildly popular with [PAWN_possessive] customers.</baseDesc>

In [PAWN_possessive] free time, [PAWN_nameDef] hunted wild game to feed [PAWN_possessive] charges.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] trained in the arts of artifice to bolster [PAWN_possessive] combat capabilities. While [PAWN_pronoun] made [PAWN_possessive] own weapons and armor and could use them well, where [PAWN_pronoun] excelled was in quickly creating various devices to gain an edge in combat. Even in the middle of battle, [PAWN_objective] could easily assemble lethal traps and jury-rigged turrets in a matter of moments.</baseDesc>
