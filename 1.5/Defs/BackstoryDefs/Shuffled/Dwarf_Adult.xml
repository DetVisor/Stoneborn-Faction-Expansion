    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was trained to battle in close quarters in tight underground spaces, such as narrow caves and corridors. [PAWN_pronoun] was knowledgeable in conventional combat techniques, but navigating and engaging the enemy in such small spaces was where [PAWN_nameDef] truly felt at home.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was tasked with watching over the mines that stoneborn were actively working in. For the most part, this meant that [PAWN_pronoun] would make sure that the miners were working efficiently while breaking up the occasional brawl. But when insectoids inevitably burrowed into a mineshaft, [PAWN_nameDef] would eliminate them with ruthless efficiency before they caused too much damage.</baseDesc>

After breaching the hull, [PAWN_nameDef] would move methodically through the ship to take out any crew that [PAWN_pronoun] could before having to withdraw.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] possessed enough influence and combat prowess to be allowed to wield rune-smithed equipment. Such an honor was quite uncommon in stoneborn society due to the quality and price of such items, which made [PAWN_objective] especially stand out from the usual rank-and-file soldiers. A mere glance of [PAWN_nameDef] was enough to inspire fervent bravery in [PAWN_possessive] allies and fear in [PAWN_possessive] foes.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] practiced the delicate art of slaying psycasters. Of course, while [PAWN_possessive] natural psychic inertness was helpful, [PAWN_pronoun] was no match for a psycaster in direct combat. Thus, [PAWN_nameDef] hunted down psycasters in long range engagements, as psychic powers were not particularly dangerous when they could not reach [PAWN_possessive].</baseDesc>
